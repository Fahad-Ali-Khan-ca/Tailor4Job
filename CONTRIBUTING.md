## Getting Started

To start contributing, fork the repository and clone your forked version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tailor4Job
cd Tailor4Job

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
     ```bash
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     ```

### Source Code Formatting

We use **Ruff** as our automatic code formatter to ensure consistent code style across the project.

1. **Install Ruff** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install ruff
   ```

2. **Run the Formatter**:
   - To format the entire codebase, use the provided `format.sh` script:
     ```bash
     ./format.sh
     ```
   - This script will automatically format all Python files in the project.

3. **Configuration**:
   - The configuration file `.ruff.toml` contains the formatting rules for Ruff.
   - Files and directories that should not be formatted (like `env` or `__pycache__`) are specified in this file.

### Linting

Ruff is also used as a linter to check for common issues and enforce best practices.

1. **Run the Linter**:
   - You can run Ruff as a linter by executing:
     ```bash
     ruff .
     ```
   - Fix any warnings or errors identified by Ruff to maintain code quality.

2. **Ignoring Specific Lines or Files**:
   - Sometimes, specific lines of code may need to be ignored by the linter. You can do this by adding a `# noqa` comment at the end of the line.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Instructions for using Ruff are included in this document for contributors who are unfamiliar with it.

### Editor/IDE Integration

For an efficient development experience, integrate Ruff with your editor to automatically format and lint code on save.

1. **VS Code Integration**:
   - Install the Ruff extension for VS Code.
   - Add a `.vscode/settings.json` file to the project with the following configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "python.formatting.provider": "ruff",
       "editor.formatOnSave": true,
       "python.linting.ruffEnabled": true
     }
     ```

2. **Other Editors**:
   - Consult Ruffâ€™s documentation to configure it in your preferred editor.

### Running Tests

To ensure your changes work as expected, run tests after making modifications.

```bash
# Example test command (update with actual test framework if applicable)
python -m unittest discover
```

### Git Workflow

1. **Create a Branch**:
   - Create a new branch for your changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-feature-branch
     ```

2. **Commit Regularly**:
   - Make small, frequent commits with clear messages:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add feature X"
     ```

3. **Squash Commits**:
   - Before merging, squash commits into a single commit:
     ```bash
     git rebase -i HEAD~[number_of_commits]
     ```

4. **Push and Open a Pull Request**:
   - Push your branch to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-feature-branch
     ```
   - Open a pull request with a description of your changes.
