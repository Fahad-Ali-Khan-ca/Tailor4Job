# Contributing to Tailor4Job

Thank you for considering contributing to Tailor4Job! This guide will help you set up the development environment, understand the structure of the project, and use tools like formatters, linters, and testing frameworks to maintain code quality.

## Getting Started

To start contributing, fork the repository and clone your forked version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tailor4Job
cd Tailor4Job
```

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
     ```bash
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     ```

## Source Code Formatting

We use **Ruff** as our automatic code formatter to ensure consistent code style across the project.

1. **Install Ruff** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install ruff
   ```

2. **Run the Formatter**:
   - To format the entire codebase, use the provided `format.sh` script, which will automatically format all Python files:
     ```bash
     ./format.sh
     ```
   - The script uses `ruff check . --fix` to format all Python files in the project directory and subdirectories.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Ruff settings are stored in `.ruff.toml`, where you can specify specific files or folders to exclude from formatting.

## Linting

Ruff is also used as a linter to check for common issues and enforce best practices.

1. **Run the Linter**:
   - To run Ruff as a linter, execute:
     ```bash
     ./lint.sh
     ```
   - This will check all Python files for code quality issues.

2. **Ignoring Specific Lines or Files**:
   - If you need to ignore specific lines, add `# noqa` at the end of the line to bypass linting errors.

## Editor/IDE Integration

For an efficient development experience, integrate Ruff with your editor to automatically format and lint code on save.

1. **VS Code Integration**:
   - Install the Ruff extension for VS Code.
   - Add a `.vscode/settings.json` file to the project with the following configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "python.formatting.provider": "ruff",
       "editor.formatOnSave": true,
       "python.linting.ruffEnabled": true
     }
     ```

## Running Tests

We use **pytest** as our testing framework, with **requests-mock** for mocking external API calls (e.g., the Groq API). Follow the steps below to set up and run tests effectively:

1. **Set the PYTHONPATH**:
   - Set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to the projectâ€™s root directory so `pytest` can locate all modules:
     ```bash
     export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
     ```

2. **Install Testing Dependencies**:
   - Install `pytest` and `requests-mock` if they are not already installed:
     ```bash
     pip install pytest requests-mock
     ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   - Run all tests using `pytest`:
     ```bash
     pytest
     ```

4. **Running a Specific Test**:
   - To test specific files or functions, you can use:
     ```bash
     pytest path/to/test_file.py
     ```
   - For instance:
     ```bash
     pytest tests/test_groq_api.py
     ```

5. **Mocking API Requests**:
   - We use `requests-mock` to mock responses from external APIs. This allows tests to simulate API responses without making real network calls. Tests that mock API responses are located in `tests/test_groq_api.py` and other files with `_api` in the name.
   - For more information on `requests-mock`, consult the [requests-mock documentation](https://requests-mock.readthedocs.io).

6. **Code Coverage** (Optional):
   - To ensure thorough testing, install `pytest-cov`:
     ```bash
     pip install pytest-cov
     ```
   - Run tests with coverage:
     ```bash
     pytest --cov=tailor4job tests/
     ```
   - This generates a coverage report, helping you identify any untested parts of your code.

## Git Workflow

1. **Create a Branch**:
   - Create a new branch for your changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-feature-branch
     ```

2. **Commit Regularly**:
   - Make small, frequent commits with clear messages:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add feature X"
     ```

3. **Squash Commits**:
   - Before merging, squash commits into a single commit:
     ```bash
     git rebase -i HEAD~[number_of_commits]
     ```

4. **Push and Open a Pull Request**:
   - Push your branch to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-feature-branch
     ```
   - Open a pull request with a description of your changes.
